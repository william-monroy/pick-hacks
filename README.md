## ✨ Inspiration
45 million Americans go on a diet each year.
Youtube has become so famous in past years, thus we can see people watching others' exercise routines, and food diets to listen to their advice. The average of those videos has a minimum of 50K views.

## 🪄 What it does
On AI content, AI will recommend some content like videos, and articles. The content depends on your goal
On reliable content, It ives scientific advice on your personal condition (age, gender)
On Blog service, you will be able to share your routines, diet, or tips categorizing by gender, pregnancy, illness, location

## ⚙️ How we built it
We follow this step

We investigate what kind of service will work
We did a market research
We collect needs and put them into a social network-type website solution.
We use technologies such as:
- React
- Next.js
- Next UI
- Next auth
- Deta
- DeepSource
- Vercel


## 🏁 Challenges we ran into
The biggest challenge was the time of  2 days to carry out a project with great impact like the one we are looking for. Also, most of us did not have enough time to work for it. However, we tried to manage our time to make it. All this was possible thanks to teamwork.

## 🏆 Accomplishments that we're proud of
We are proud to make this project even we did not have enough time to work and learn new technologies such as Next UI, Next Auth, Deta, Deep Source and Vercel

## 💡 What we learned
As we were not in the same city we had to work online so we needed to have enough conversation to concrete our solution and we improved our skills in code collaboration tools like Git and GitHub. By having the different experiences we talked about our technical skills to decide which language, frameworks, platforms, etc. we are going to use. Also, we have improved our communication and technical skills by working on this Hackathon.

## 💡 What's next for Be healthier with tech
The key to make our social network successful and being able to support a lot of people is to make it easy to use and accessible from anywhere, so we have proposed a website that you don't need to download on your phone and to be able to use it as a Web application. This is our roadmap for Be health with tech:

### 2022 - May:
- Web application launch.
- Influencer marketing

### 2022 - June:
- Add new features based on user feedback.
- Preparing to support more languages to reach more audiences

### 2022 - August
- Prepare the creation of our mobile application with React Native
